## Pull requests are welcomed
If you encountered some papers with interesting titles, or if your paper's title is interesting, please feel free to open a pull request (simply adding your paper's bibtex into the appropriate bibtex files [Here](bibs))!
If you want the hyperlink functional, simply add an `url` field in your bibtex directing to the paper's webpage/ArXiV/ACM DL, etc.
