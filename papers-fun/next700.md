    abstract = "We propose the first framework for defining relational program logics for arbitrary monadic effects. The framework is embedded within a relational dependent type theory and is highly expressive. At the semantic level, we provide an algebraic presentation of relational specifications as a class of relative monads, and link computations and specifications by introducing relational effect observations, which map pairs of monadic computations to relational specifications in a way that respects the algebraic structure. For an arbitrary relational effect observation, we generically define the core of a sound relational program logic, and explain how to complete it to a full-fledged logic for the monadic effect at hand. We show that this generic framework can be used to define relational program logics for effects as diverse as state, input-output, nondeterminism, and discrete probabilities. We, moreover, show that by instantiating our framework with state and unbounded iteration we can embed a variant of Benton's Relational Hoare Logic, and also sketch how to reconstruct Relational Hoare Type Theory. Finally, we identify and overcome conceptual challenges that prevented previous relational program logics from properly dealing with control effects, and are the first to provide a relational program logic for exceptions.",

Such languages, which include pads, datascript, and packettypes, are designed to facilitate programming with ad hoc data, that is, data not in well-behaved relational or xml formats. In the calculus, each type describes the physical layout and semantic properties of a data source. In the semantics, we interpret types simultaneously as the in-memory representation of the data described and as parsers for the data source. The parsing functions are robust, automatically detecting and recording errors in the data stream without halting parsing. We show the parsers are type-correct, returning data whose type matches the simple-type interpretation of the specification. We also prove the parsers are “error-correct,” accurately reporting the number of physical and semantic errors that occur in the returned data. We use the calculus to describe the features of various data description languages, and we discuss how we have used the calculus to improve pads.",

This framework dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined names, and the conventions about characterizing functional relationships.

The other is the choice of the abstract entities (such as numbers, character-strings, list of them, functional relations among them) that can be referred to in the language.The system is biased towards “expressions” rather than “statements.” It includes a nonprocedural (purely functional) subsystem that aims to expand the class of users' needs that can be met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificing the important properties that make conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.",
